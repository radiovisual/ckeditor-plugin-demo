> The aim of this tutorial is to demonstrate how to create a basic CKEditor plugin. We are going to develop an abbreviation plugin that lets the users insert abbreviations into their documents. The abbreviations will be using the <abbr> HTML element and will be added through a dialog window that is opened after clicking a dedicated toolbar button.
