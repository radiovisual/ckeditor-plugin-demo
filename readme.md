# ckeditor-plugin-demo

Annotated source code files for the completed `abbr` plugin project highlighted in this tutorial series:

- [Creating a Simple CKEditor Plugin (Part 1)](http://docs.ckeditor.com/#!/guide/plugin_sdk_sample_1)
- [Creating a Simple CKEditor Plugin (Part 2)](http://docs.ckeditor.com/#!/guide/plugin_sdk_sample_2)

> The aim of this tutorial is to demonstrate how to create a basic CKEditor plugin. We are going to develop an abbreviation plugin that lets the users insert abbreviations into their documents. The abbreviations will be using the <abbr> HTML element and will be added through a dialog window that is opened after clicking a dedicated toolbar button.

**Note:** This repository is mainly here for my own personal reference. You should review the tutorials above if you are interested in the content, or fork the project if you want to add to the annotated source.
